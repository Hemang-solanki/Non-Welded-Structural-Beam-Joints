## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the **Non-Welded-Structural-Beam-Joints** project! This system helps you quickly construct modular beam joints without needing to weld. You can enjoy the benefits of secure and stable structures using our gravity-based clamps. 

### 📦 Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or newer / macOS Sierra or newer / Ubuntu 20.04 or newer
- **Graphics Software**: A 3D modeling software such as Tinkercad, Fusion 360, or similar to visualize the designs. 

### 🔍 Features
- Modular design allows for easy assembly and disassembly.
- Utilizes cross-shaped self-locking clamps to hold beams firmly.
- Conceptual designs created with user-friendly software.

## 🌐 About the Project
This project showcases a modular beam-joining system developed to assist builders and DIY enthusiasts. The design focuses on enabling rapid construction without the need for welding, utilizing gravity and innovative clamp designs. As of now, this concept has not been physically tested or 3D printed.

## 🔧 Assembly Instructions
To assemble your beam joints, follow these general steps:

1. **Gather Materials**: Collect the beams and clamps. Ensure all parts are available before you begin.

2. **Position the Beams**: Set your beams in the desired layout. Make sure you have adequate space for assembly.

3. **Attach the Clamps**: Secure each joint using the cross-shaped clamps. Ensure they lock in place, as intended.

4. **Check Stability**: Make sure the entire structure is stable. Adjust positions if necessary.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, consider the following tips:

- Ensure all clamps are securely locked.
- Verify that beams are cut to the same length for a stable structure.
- Check that you are using the correct software version compatible with your operating system.
